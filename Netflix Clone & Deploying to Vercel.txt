https://archive.org/ => get old versions of different websites like Netflix.

Resolutions:
big screens => 990px and above
medium screens => 586px to 990px
small screens => less than 586px

Deploying the project to Vercel:
Visit https://vercel.com/.
Create a new account using Github creds.
Push the project to Github.
Import it in the Vercel and get a link.

If you want to make any chnages to ur app then update the code and push it to the git hub repo.
The same will be automatically reflected on to the vercel. So its real time, superfast and free to use.
Hence avoid using Github pages and use Vercel instead.
